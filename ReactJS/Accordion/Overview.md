# Overview

The **Accordion** control is an interface where lists of items can be collapsed or expanded. It has several collapsible panels where only one can be expanded at a time that is useful for dashboards where space is limited. Each **Accordion** control has a template for its header and its content.

**Key Features**

* **Collapsible Header**: All headers are collapsible. 
* **AJAX Load**: Load AJAX content in the **Accordion** content panel.
* **Icon Customization**: The expand and collapse icons can be customized.
* **Custom Event for Expand Header**: By default, **Accordion** panels can be expanded and collapsed on a single click. However, this action can be customized to occur on mouse-over or mouse-up through custom events.
* **Multiple Open**: Multiple items can be expanded.
* **Auto Size**: The content panel height can be predefined with values such as content, auto, and fill.
* **Theme**: Essential JavaScript controls feature 12 built-in themes (six flat themes and six with gradient effects), and also supports custom skin options to set user-defined themes.
* **RTL**: Accordion headers and content text can display RTL languages. 
* **Keyboard Navigation**: You can expand and collapse panels using the keyboard.
