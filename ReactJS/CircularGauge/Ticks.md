# Ticks

Ticks are used to mark some values on the scale. Based on the tickâ€™s value you can set the labels on the required position.

## Adding Tick Collection 

Tick collection is directly added to the scale object. Refer the following code example to add tick collection in a **Gauge** control.

{% highlight javascript %}

"use strict";

var scales = [{
        ticks: [{
            value: 30
        }]
    }];
ReactDOM.render(
            <ej.circulargauge id="circulargauge1" scales={scales}></ej.circulargauge>,

            document.getElementById('CircularGauge1')
            );


{% endhighlight %}



Execute the above code to render the following output.

## Tick Customization

Height and width of the ticks can be applied by using the properties **height** and **width**. You can customize ticks with the properties such as angle, color, etc. **angle** attribute is used to display the labels in the specified angles and **color** attribute is used to display the labels in specified color. Ticks are two types such as major and minor.

Major type ticks are for major interval values and minor type ticks are for minor interval values.You can position ticks with the help of two properties such as **distanceFromScale** and **placement**. **distanceFromScale** property defines the distance between the scale and ticks.  **Placement** property is used to locate the ticks with respect to scale either inside the scale or outside the scale or along the scale. It is an enumerable data type.

{% highlight javascript %}
"use strict";
var scales = [{
        ticks: [
                        // For setting tick1
                        { type: "major", color: "Red" },
                        // For setting tick2
                        {
                            // For setting tick type
                            type: "minor",
                            // For setting tick color
                            color: "yellow",
                            // For setting tick height
                            height: 8,
                            // For setting tick placement
                            placement: "near",
                            // For setting tick distance from scale
                            distanceFromScale: 5
                        }]
    }];
ReactDOM.render(
            <ej.circulargauge id="circulargauge1" scales={scales}></ej.circulargauge>,

            document.getElementById('CircularGauge1')
            );


{% endhighlight %}


Execute the above code to render the following output.
