# Overview

Our Essential ReactJS Splitter component enables you to divide a Web page into distinct areas by inserting resizable panes. You can create any number of Splitter panes and place them inside the Splitter component. The split bars are inserted automatically in between the adjacent panes.

## Key Features

  * **Expand or Collapse Panes**: Support for expanding or collapsing panes by using the Expand or Collapse arrows.
  * **Animation**:  Supports for animating panes while expanding or collapsing the panes, and also setting the animation speed.
  * **Window Resizing**: Supports for resizing the Splitter while resizing the window.
  * **RTL**: Supports for right to left alignment of Splitter panes.
