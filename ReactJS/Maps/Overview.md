# Maps

A **Map** is a graphical representation of geographical data. It is used to represent the statistical data of a particular geographical area on Earth. Using pan and zoom, the maps can be navigated. Maps supports enhanced data visualization with bubbles and labels using data bound to the map.

## Use Case Scenarios

Some of the **Maps** control use case scenarios:

1. To visualize weather data.

2. To visualize geographical statistics information.

3. To visualize the density or availability of resources in an area.

4. To visualize political information.

5. To visualize the layout of a building.

## Key Features

* **Layers** - Map is maintained through Layers and it can accommodate one or more layers.
