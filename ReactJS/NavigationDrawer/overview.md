* **Direction:** To change the list view options from the right or left side of the window screen for specifying the direction of the Navigation Drawer. 
* **Type:** To change the transition for specifying the type of the Navigation Drawer.
* **Consider SubPage:** Specifies whether the Navigation Drawer to be rendered inside the closest sub page or not.
* **Position:** Specifies the position of the Navigation Drawer whether it's fixed or relative to the page.
